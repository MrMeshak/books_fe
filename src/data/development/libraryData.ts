        description:
          "It has never been shown that human emissions of the gas of life drive global warming. Large bodies of science that don't fit the narrative have been ignored by IPCC, COP and self-interested scientists paid by taxpayers. A huge subsidised industry of intermittent unreliable wind and solar electricity has been created based on unsubstantiated science. The same hucksters now want subsidised hydrogen, costly inefficient EVs, subsidised mega-batteries and other horribly expensive tried and failed schemes to impoverish people, create unemployment, transfer wealth and enrich China. Germany, Texas, California and the UK had a glimpse of Net Zero with blackouts, astronomically high electricity costs and hundreds of deaths. We once had reliable cheap electricity and now that governments have gone green, we are heading for hard economic times. In this book I charge the greens with murder. They murder humans who are kept in eternal poverty without coal-fired electricity. They support slavery and early deaths of black child miners. They murder forests and their wildlife by clear felling for mining and wind turbines. They murder forests and wildlife with their bushfire policies. They murder economies producing unemployment, hopelessness, collapse of communities, disrupted social cohesion and suicide. They murder free speech and freedoms and their takeover of the education system has ended up in the murdering of the intellectual and economic future of young people. They terrify children into mental illness with their apocalyptic death cult lies and exaggerations. They try to divide a nation. They are hypocrites and such angry ignorant people should never touch other people's money. The greens are guilty of murder. The sentence is life with no parole in a cave in the bush enjoying the benefits of Net Zero.",

        description:
          '1977, Collingwood. Two young women are brutally murdered. The killer has never been found. What happened in the house on Easey Street? On a warm night in January, Suzanne Armstrong and Susan Bartlett were savagely murdered in their house on Easey Street, Collingwood – stabbed multiple times while Suzanne’s sixteen-month-old baby slept in his cot. Although police established a list of more than 100 ‘persons of interest’, the case became one of the most infamous unsolved crimes in Melbourne. Journalist Helen Thomas was a cub reporter at The Age when the murders were committed and saw how deeply they affected the city. Now, forty-two years on, she has re-examined the cold case – chasing down new leads and talking to members of the Armstrong and Bartlett families, the women’s neighbours on Easey Street, detectives and journalists. What emerges is a portrait of a crime rife with ambiguities and contradictions, which took place at a fascinating time in the city’s history – when the countercultural bohemia of Helen Garner’s Monkey Grip brushed up against the grit of the underworld in one of Melbourne’s most notorious suburbs. Why has the Easey Street murderer never been found, despite the million-dollar reward for information leading to an arrest? Did the women know their killer, or were their deaths due to a random, frenzied attack? Could the murderer have killed again? This gripping account addresses these questions and more as it sheds new light on one of Australia’s most disturbing and compelling criminal mysteries. ‘An overdue examination of the Easey Street murders that adds tantalising new information to known and forgotten facts.’ —Andrew Rule, journalist and co-author of Underbelly ‘Helen Thomas’ meticulous examination [is] chilling reading.’ —The Age',

          'Why is it that some people are convicted of murders that they did not commit, while others are not convicted of murders that they did commit? Australian Police Services are generally well funded, so something more must be involved. Just what that is, is investigated in this book. To minimise the prospect of future errors, we need both to scrutinise past cases where errors have been revealed, and to investigate police training procedures with a view to uncovering any errors of omission or commission, to see what scope there is for improvements. Each of us has good reason to take an interest in such matters, since any one of us could be a victim if we are in the wrong place at the wrong time. In fact all of us are victims to the extent that some guilty parties continue to walk free on our streets, and as taxpayers all of us fund the additional costs of dealing with crime, including the sizeable compensation payments that are made to those whose wrongful convictions are quashed. This book deals with instructive cases which continue to agitate the public mind, and makes practical suggestions for improved procedures.',

          "**WINNER OF THE 2020 DANGER PRIZE** From the acclaimed author of THE SUITCASE BABY and THE SUICIDE BRIDE, the fascinating story of a series of horrific murders that began in 1930s Sydney - and a killer who remained at large for over two decades. In December 1932, as the Depression tightened its grip, the body of a woman was found in Queens Park, Sydney. It was a popular park. There were houses in plain view. Yet this woman had been violently murdered without anyone noticing. Other equally brutal and shocking murders of women in public places were to follow. Australia's first serial killer was at large. Police failed to notice the similarities between the victims until the death of one young woman - an aspiring Olympic swimmer - made the whole city take notice. On scant evidence, the unassuming Eric Craig was arrested. But the killings didn't stop... A compelling story of a city crippled by fear and what happens when victims are blamed and suspects are presumed guilty, The Killing Streets investigates how a murderer could remain free to kill again. **Includes a BONUS extract from Tanya Bretherton's compelling new book THE HUSBAND POISONER**",

          'Murder by the Book? is a thorough - and thoroughly enjoyable - look at the blossoming genre of the feminist crime novel in Britain and the United States. Sally Munt asks why the form has proved so attractive as a vehicle for oppositional politics; whether the pleasures of detective fiction can be truly transgressive; and when exactly it was that the dyke detective appeared as the new super-hero for today. Along the way Munt poses some critical questions about the relations between fiction and activism, politics and representations, the writer and the reader. This will be an enticing book both for addicts of the genre and for teachers and their students.',

          "Alvin Benson, is found in his brownstone mansion with a bullet through his head. First on the scene is Philo Vance, amateur detective, who is at once intrigued by the absence of Alvin's toupee and his false teeth. With a jigsaw of odd clues he sets off in pursuit of an elusive murderer, making obvious his disdain for the professional crime-solvers of the police and the DA's office. To him, they seem to be hopelessly addicted to the pernicious practice of looking for physical clues and circumstantial evidence. His own theory is that psychology is the key.",

          'Two people from a small town are found dead from what seem nonsuspicious circumstances. One thought to be a suicide and the other a result from a heart attack. The deaths are a few days apart and, to the local constabulary, seem unrelated. However, after further forensic investigation, both deaths are declared as murder. Nestled amongst green rolling hills and stately Red Gums lies Jacaranda Estate, a well-established family business of vegetable growers dependent on the nearby town for its labourers and owned by the Walshe family. Their secretary Donna finds her employer, Cordelia Walshe dead at her desk from a suspected heart attack. A few days earlier, Shaun O’Brien; the Walshe’s truck driver is found by his cleaner hanging in his garage, the cause an apparent suicide. Detective Inspector Daniels is seconded to the cases and throughout his investigation; family jealousy, deception, half-truths, and an insulated community thwart him. Daniels eventually unravels a trail of conspiracy, debt and murder. Suddenly the investigation becomes personal and Daniels is caught up in a web of retribution that may cost him a friendship.',

          'Child murder: a social taboo and one of the most abhorrent acts most of us can imagine. Meet the women found guilty of murdering their own children. They represent some of the most hated women in Australia. The infamous list includes psychologically damaged, sometimes deranged, women on the edge. But, as we will see, accused doesn t always mean guilty. Among the cases covered is that of Kathleen Folbigg, accused and found guilty of killing four of her children, even with a lack of any forensic evidence proving her guilt; Rachel Pfitzner, who strangled her 2-year-old son and dumped his body in a duck pond; as well as Keli Lane, found guilty of child murder though no body has ever been found. Dr Mallett goes back to the beginning of each case death s ground zero. That might be the accused s childhood, were they abused? Or was their motivation greed, or fear of losing a partner? Were they just simply evil? Or did the media paint them as such, against the evidence and leading to a travesty of justice? Each case will be re-opened, the alternative suspects assessed, the possible motives reviewed. Informed by her background as a forensic scientist, Xanthe will offer insight into aspects of the cases that may not have been explored previously. Taking you on her journey through the facts, and reaching her own conclusion as to whether she believes the evidence points to the women s guilt. Hear their stories."',
